# Webcam-Sampler

Automated sampling of webcam imaging via Excel VBA.

- Automated Webcam Sampler.xlsm &nbsp;&nbsp; Macro-enabled Excel workbook.<br />

Automated sampling of webcam imaging was investigated as a means of meteor data collection. A sampling system was built with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), the scripting language built into Microsoft's Office suite. The file may be used as a standalone sampler, but knowledge of VBA macro execution in Excel is assumed.
